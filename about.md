I am Mark Stoodley, living and working in Markham, Ontario, Canada. I spent many many years in school learning about computer engineering and did graduate work in compilers and computer architecture. I am currently a project lead for the [Eclipse OpenJ9](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9) and the [Eclipse OMR](https://github.com/eclipseomr) projects, and I work during the day as a Senior Software Developer in the IBM Runtime Technologies team. I am a husband and a father, which is to say I've been encouraged not to take myself very seriously.
