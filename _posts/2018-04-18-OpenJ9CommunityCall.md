title: Ask the OpenJ9 Community weekly call
---

Every Wednesday at 11am EST, a few members of the Eclipse OpenJ9 developer community
(some days more, some days fewer) get together for about a half hour to discuss topics
of relevance for OpenJ9 users and for the OpenJ9 project. We usually meet via a Zoom
video conference
([Here's a simple tutorial if you've never used Zoom before](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/how-to-join-a-zoom-meeting-step-by-step/)).

One of our most important goals for this video conference is to make sure our users have
a regular opportunity to engage with us directly to give us their feedback. Now that
there are JCK certified JDK8 binaries at the AdoptOpenJDK project for OpenJDK8 with
Eclipse OpenJ9, it’s the perfect opportunity to try a production-ready JVM and then
talk directly to the community that develops it to make sure it does what you need.
If this week doesn’t work, we’ll be there the next week, and every week after that
too. Your feedback is important to us, so we can feed your requirements into our
next release (currently expected some time in May, with more platforms and better
diagnostic capabiltiies!).

A second reason we meet every week is to talk about a few high level topics that are
important for the OpenJ9 project: things like our release plans, our platform support,
our continuous integration pipeline on our Jenkins instance, the testing we can afford
to do at our project on every pull request and as part of our release schedule, what
things we can do to help grow our user base and our community, etc. Any topic is fair
game at this meeting, so long as it pertains to Eclipse OpenJ9 (or even our base
technology project, [Eclipse OMR](https://github.com/eclipse/omr))!

So, if you have tried Eclipse OpenJ9 and wish it could be even better, or you just want
to understand where this new open source JVM technology is going, or if you want to learn
more about some particular feature of Eclipse OpenJ9 (like OpenJ9's lower footprint, or faster
start-up, or how our dynamic AOT compiled code works, or our powerful tracing and diagnostic
options), please feel free to join us at our weekly hangout. Everyone is welcome!

For details on how to join, which is usually posted a few minutes ahead of each meeting,
